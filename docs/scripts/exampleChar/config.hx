		* hi hi hello gabi here
		* this is a example file to show how characters work on the engine
		==========================================================================================
		* first off, as long as your sparrow/packer atlas file and image file is in the folder containing this script
		* you should be good to go, furthermore, they need to be named with your character's internal name
		* for example, if the character folder name is `bf`, then his internal name is `bf`, and so, files need to be named `bf.png` and `bf.(ext)` (ext being either xml, json or txt);
		* along with this script, which should be named `config.hx`, and of course the character icon, which should be named `icon.png`
